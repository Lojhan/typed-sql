# Query-contract implementation evidence

PR #280 implements query contracts, persistent offline reuse and configured live regeneration.
The architecture target is described in [the specification](./spec.md); it is broader than the
native transport currently qualified by this PR.

## Scope

- Keep the existing offline grammar catalogs and semantics from the base branch.
- Add neutral, bounded contracts, reconciliation, context identities and durable closures.
- Add the disposable `.typed-sql` cache, scheduling, invalidation and cancellation.
- Integrate offline, frozen and live modes with the compiler, CLI and language server.
- Isolate lightweight runtime/profile entrypoints from eager analysis and optional drivers.
- Qualify PostgreSQL expression-query acquisition with independent static reconciliation.

The exhaustive upstream inventory, vendor fact extraction, global catalog model, generated
completeness reports and selected-version/core/compatibility-pack APIs are excluded. Normal
builds and installations do not fetch database sources or require a global engine inventory.
The existing PostgreSQL/MySQL catalog generators also derive small runtime codec projections
from their maintained catalog inputs, preserving compile-time/runtime policy agreement.

## Qualification limits

PostgreSQL native acquisition is restricted to the documented expression-query profile.
The other four grammars retain their existing offline support and contract-profile interfaces;
they do not acquire broader native query-description qualification from this change.
Project routine catalog library APIs support PostgreSQL fixed scalar declarations. Automatic
catalog generation/refresh in the CLI and editors, other grammar interpreters, custom type/rule
qualification and workload-selected offline packs remain incomplete.

## Validation

The reduced implementation passes the full build, typecheck, quality, documentation and performance gates;
138 grammar/init test files; 49 repository/native-type contract files including packed consumers;
and 18 focused contract, cache, reconciliation and codec test files. A real PostgreSQL 18 run
passes non-executing acquisition, connection-loss handling, routine/context drift, editor and CLI
live regeneration, watching, and disconnected packed consumption.

Historical bundle measurements for the excluded catalog pipeline are removed because they do
not describe this implementation.

## Strict project generation evidence

The real PostgreSQL helper also changes a successful built-in result rule after a complete
three-query export. Using the same config identity, database context and cache namespace,
generation and `--check` reject the wrong static claim, persist the conflict and preserve the
durable manifest. Restoring the analyzer succeeds through fresh native reconciliation. This
closes the project-level verification gap for acceptance scenario 20 in the supported expression
profile; broader native engine and statement qualification remains incomplete.

## Selected reusable routine metadata

The neutral project catalog envelope reuses context identities, bounded canonical JSON and
schema validation. Grammar contributions own interpretation and permissions; duplicate owners
or declaration identities fail before analysis. Catalog selection changes the effective profile
identity, and applying metadata recomputes the schema hash and clears stale generator metadata.

PostgreSQL selects complete native overload families by walking project SQL. Its interpreter
recomputes known scalar types from policy, preserves raw parameter/default declarations and
requires nullable outputs. The resolver enforces these permissions before builtin dispatch,
including table-call and builtin-name collision cases. Unqualified calls require explicit
qualification; polymorphic/defaulted/variadic/decimal-dependent/table declarations need exact
query evidence. This is an explicit library path, not automatic CLI catalog generation.

The real PostgreSQL 18 proof captures routine metadata inside a guarded context window and a
read-only snapshot, serializes the selected catalog, and compiles a different SQL statement
without describing that invocation or executing its function. It checks parameter/result
codec plans and a strict function that actually returns NULL for non-null input. Native type
identities now retain their namespaces; display names alone cannot authorize reuse.

Validation for this addition: build and typecheck; analysis and PostgreSQL coverage gates;
repository contracts; packed consumers with project-catalog modules physically absent from the
frozen/runtime path; documentation and quality checks; the real PostgreSQL helper; and the
existing performance budgets. No global source inventory or generated mapping blob is added.
